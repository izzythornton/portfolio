        <h3>Me & Web Development</h3>
        <p>I fell in love with web development and design by watching my older brother. He started building websites back in high school and quickly advanced his career over the years. He's created
           some truly beautiful artwork for amazing companies, and I feel lucky to have him as an inspiration and as a teacher as I start down this path!</p>
        <p>For my day job, though, I
           work in software technical support largely because of my passion for people. I love working in a team environment, being the voice of the customer, and interacting with
           our engineering and product teams to understand and help improve our platform. I'm so excited to be able to take those skills to the next level and be able to play a more significant
           and challenging role.</p>
        <h3>Me & Life</h3>
        <p>I absolutely love nature and exploring eastern Washington with my friends, boyfriend, and dog... but cuddling my cat at home with a good show on is almost as good! When I'm not
           doing that I'm usually attending various music events, playing video games, or keeping myself busy by learning something new.</p>
